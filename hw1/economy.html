    <p>Bitcoin was created to function as a currency, but its status as money remains debated. While it shares some
        characteristics of traditional money—such as limited supply and verifiability—it does not fully meet the
        economic criteria of a stable store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account due to high price
        volatility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, Bitcoin has evolved from a niche technology into a significant part of global financial markets, with
        increasing institutional adoption and growing links to traditional financial systems and macroeconomic
        indicators. This integration has raised important questions about financial stability, monetary policy, and risk
        management.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bitcoin’s classification varies across governments and institutions: it has been described as a currency,
        commodity, asset, virtual currency, or investment, depending on jurisdiction. Despite ongoing debate over its
        precise definition, Bitcoin is widely used as a payment system and investment vehicle, with global adoption
        continuing to grow among individuals and institutions.
