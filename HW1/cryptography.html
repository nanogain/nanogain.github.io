    <p>Cryptography is a field of cryptology focused on securing messages by ensuring confidentiality, authenticity, and
        integrity through the use of secret keys. Unlike steganography, which hides messages within other content,
        cryptography makes messages unreadable to unauthorized parties. Used since ancient times, cryptography has
        evolved significantly, with modern techniques such as asymmetric cryptography emerging in the late 20th century.
    </p>
    <p>The discipline includes concepts such as encryption, decryption, cryptosystems, and cryptanalysis, and its
        terminology originates from Greek words meaning “hidden” and “writing.” Historically, cryptography played a
        strategic role in military and political communication, from ancient ciphers like Caesar’s cipher to complex
        systems used during World War II. With the rise of computers, cryptography became widely embedded in everyday
        technologies such as secure web communication and payment systems. Today, the field continues to evolve with
        post-quantum cryptography, which aims to develop algorithms resistant to quantum computing threats.</p>
